speaker_consistency.py — Cross-session speaker identity verification.

Compares the current speaker's embedding against an enrolled profile
to detect speaker identity anomalies (i.e., a different person pretending
to be an enrolled speaker).

Cross-session consistency checks comparing ongoing call features against
historical genuine samples to detect anomalies in speaker identity.

    Maintains a reference speaker profile and checks ongoing
