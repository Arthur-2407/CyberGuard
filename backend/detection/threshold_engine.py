"""
threshold_engine.py — Alert threshold evaluation and recommendation engine.

Evaluates the current risk score against configured thresholds and
produces actionable recommendations for frontline staff.

Features:
- Threshold-based alerting logic configurable for different risk scenarios
- Pre-transaction warning prompts recommending secondary verification

Alert levels (ascending severity):
  SAFE → LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH → CRITICAL
