"""
websocket_notifier.py — Real-time WebSocket alert push for CyberGuard.

Manages connected WebSocket clients and delivers detection updates
to the specific session that produced them — NOT to all clients.

Session isolation design:
  - Each WebSocket connection is registered with its session_id on connect().
  - notify() delivers the alert only to the WebSocket that owns the session.
  - broadcast_raw() remains available for system-wide messages (health, etc.).
